                <p>ONI is a clan comprised of passionate gamers who are eager to expand the ideals of a military-based clan. We are both a group of friends and a Milsim group with the goal of providing a fun and safe gaming experience while teaching players high-level skills for the game. We emphasize teamwork and learning game mechanics, all while incorporating aspects of intelligence gathering and military structure.</p>

              <h2>Clan History</h2>
              <p>We were established in 2014 on Halo Reach with a gathering of friends who initially sought a group capable of providing the UNSC with accurate intelligence. Over time, during Project Blacklight, I was selected as the Commander-in-Chief (CINC) to oversee the Midwest Office of Naval Intelligence. After nine years, the Midwest group has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the only team to officially develop a replica of the UNSC Spartan II Conscription files, originally created by Dr. Halsey and recreated under my leadership as CINC Ava.</p>
